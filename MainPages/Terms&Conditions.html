                <br>
                <h2>Our Right to Use User Content</h2>
                <p>You do not have to submit anything to us, but if you choose to submit any User Content to the Site, it will be deemed non-proprietary and non-confidential and may be used by us, our affiliates or others without restriction. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control any and all rights in and to the User Content that you submit and that our public posting and use of that User Content will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party in any manner, including without limitation any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights. By submitting, sending, posting, uploading, modifying or otherwise providing information, material, or any other communication to us including User Content, whether solicited or unsolicited, you grant us and our designees the royalty-free, fully paid, unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, and fully transferable, assignable, sublicensable right and license to use, copy, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, improve, distribute, commercialize, perform, or display such User Content (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for any purpose, including, without limitation, advertising and promotional purposes, reproduction, transmission, publication, broadcast and posting without any further consent by you or notice, credit and/or compensation to you or any third parties. You also hereby do and shall grant each user of the Site a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Site, and to use, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Content.

                <p>This site may offer you the opportunity to subscribe to auto-refill your purchase. Your subscription will continue until you cancel it.

                <br>
                <h2>Orders, Prohibition on Reselling</h2>
                <p>While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.</p>
                <br>
                <p>All orders shipped are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You may not purchase any item from this site for resale by you or any other person. The prices displayed on the site are quoted in U.S. dollars and are intended to be valid and effective only in the United States. We have the right to refuse or cancel orders placed, including but not limited to orders where product(s) is listed at an incorrect price regardless of whether the order has been confirmed or your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, we will issue a credit to your credit card account.</p>
                <br>
