                <h1>Summary Privacy Notice & Notice at Collection</h1>
                <h1>Updated January 1, 2026</h1>
                <br>
                <p>This brand is a member of the L’Oréal USA S/D, Inc. family of brands.  When we say "Us", "Our",  "We", or "L'Oréal", We are referring to L'Oréal USA S/D, Inc. This Summary Privacy Notice supplements Our Privacy Notice by providing key information to You about how We collect and use personal information about You.  This Summary Privacy Notice is for consumers in the United States only.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>Our detailed Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information We collect from You directly, from Your interactions with Us (on Our websites, mobile apps, and digital tools (collectively, “Sites”) and advertising), and from third parties; how We use it; how We protect it; and Your rights as Our consumer.  For residents of the State of Washington, our Washington Consumer Health Data Notice and applies to personal information defined as ‘consumer health data’ subject to the Washington State My Health My Data Act.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Visitors from other countries should visit the L’Oréal brand site for Your part of the world.  There is a separate privacy notice located on the L’Oréal Careers website for job applicants and a separate Business Customer Privacy Notice for individuals who engage with L’Oréal in a professional capacity.  Our contact details are available at the end of the detailed Privacy Notice in the “How to Contact Us” section.  </p>
                <br>
                <h2>What Types of Personal Information Do We Collect and for What Purposes?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The personal information that We collect about a specific person will depend on, for example, Our relationship or interaction with that person. We collect personal information that You provide to Us, from Your engagement with Our brand Sites and platforms, advertising, media; from third parties who have Your permission to share it with Us; and automatically collected (such as through cookies and other similar technologies).  </p>
                <br>
                <p>We combine information that We collect via one method (e.g., from a website or Our digital advertising) with another method (e.g., an offline event) for the purposes outlined in the Privacy Notice. For example, if You have an account with Us and are logged in, or otherwise provide personal information like an email, We associate information We observe about You with other information You or a third party provide to Us. We do this to get a more complete view of Your preferences for Our beauty products and services, which, in turn, allows Us to serve You better and with more customization and better beauty products.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our Sites and services may, including using artificial intelligence (such as machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, or generative AI) (collectively, “AI”), process personal information automatically to generate responses, gain insights, and for other purposes disclosed in this Privacy notice. For example:</p>                
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>As part of a product or service We provide to You: When You interact with certain of Our Sites and Our beauty tools, such as Virtual Try On tools and other virtual beauty tools available on our Sites, We collect inputs directly from You, as well as inputs We observe or collect automatically or obtain from third-parties, to generate personalized outputs.  </li>
                    <li>Operations. We leverage a variety of automated technologies, including AI, for Our operational purposes. For example, We leverage automated technologies to identify and classify the reason a customer reaches out to Us, to help Our customer service agents identify solutions, and help Our customer service agents prepare a response.  We apply internal or third-party machine learning or artificial intelligence models to improve Our products and services, for market research, to personalize marketing, and other purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice.</li>
                    <li>Safety and Security. We leverage automated technologies, including AI, to enforce Our terms and policies, protect our rights, and to keep Our products and services safe and secure.  </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>When Do We Share Personal Information? </h2>
                <p>We share personal information with third parties (vendors, agencies, and businesses) that help Us run Our Sites, Our business, and retail Our products to further L’Oréal’s beauty mission. Other members of the L’Oréal Group may access personal information about You when they perform services on behalf of L’Oréal USA and, unless prohibited under applicable law, for use on their own behalf for the purposes described in this Notice. We may disclose information to Our service providers, to complete a transaction requested by You, when required by law or authorities, and in the event of a sale or reorganization of Our company. Some of Our virtual beauty tools use Azure OpenAI services. The Azure OpenAI service includes content monitoring and abuse monitoring features. To detect and mitigate abuse, Azure OpenAI stores all prompts and generated content for up to thirty (30) days to review prompts for abuse where it is accessible by human reviewers. More information is available about how we share personal information about You in the “How We Share Personal Information” section of Our detailed Privacy Notice.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>We do not ‘sell’ (as ‘sell’ is traditionally defined) personal information about Our consumers.  We do not make available or provide consumer’s names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, or other personal information to third parties in exchange for money.  Like many companies, however, We do share or make available personal information We collect with third parties to facilitate Our advertising, including providing You with personalized advertising from Us about Our products and services on other third-party sites or online applications.  In some US States, this type of activity is considered (1) a ‘sale’, (2) a ‘share’ or ‘use’ of personal information for targeted advertising, or (3) both, and subject to a right of opt-out.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For example, some third parties allow Us to serve consumers with online promotions by sending identifiers or contact information (e.g., email, phone number, other identifiers (cookie ID, device ID, pseudonymous ID)) We have collected to the third party (e.g., social media platforms, streaming services, online publishers, etc.). The third party compares the identifiers or contact information to identifiers in its own database, and, if there is a match, We can use this information to optimize our advertising campaign(s), choose whether or not to serve an advertisement to the matched individual on a third-party site or platform, analytics (e.g., better inform where to place our advertisements), and measure the effectiveness of Our advertising.  We can also send this information to adtech providers (like demand side platforms) that help Us serve advertisements to You on third-party sites or online applications that participate in online auctions of their ad inventory. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Additionally, We make available personal information to third parties through Our use of cookies and other similar technologies on Our Site. For example, we share or make available online personal information with third parties such as social media platforms or other marketing service companies to optimize our marketing campaigns, help Us display ads for Our goods and services on third-party sites, and measure the effectiveness of those ads on such thirds party sites.  These companies use personal information to improve their own products and optimize their own ad targeting systems.   </p>
                <br>
                <p>To exercise the right of opt-out where available in Your jurisdiction please use one or more of the following:  </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>visit the “Your Privacy Choices” link on the footer of Our Site to submit a request regarding offline (non-browsing) personal information. </li>
                    <li>click on “Online Preferences” link on the footer of Our Site and change the setting regarding online (browsing) personal information.  </li>
                    <li>enable a browser-based opt-out signal such as the Global Privacy Control.  Where required by applicable law We will treat browser-based opt-out signals as requests to opt-out of the sale/sharing (or use) of personal information for targeted advertising for Your browser.  If you are logged-in to Your account (where available), We will associate the browser-based opt-out signal with Your account and apply it to offline personal information. </li>
